// Declare two variables: student and name.
// Assign the value "Mikko" to name.
// Copy the value from name to student.
// Console.log the value of student (must ouput "Mikko").

let student, name;
name = "Mikko";
student = name;
console.log(student);

// Why is name strikethrough?
// name is an obsolete property of the Window object. 
// When you see a strikethrough on a variable, VS Code knows that it is deprecated.
